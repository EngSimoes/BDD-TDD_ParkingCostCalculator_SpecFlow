# BDD/TDD With SpecFlow & .NET Core

[![main](https://github.com/tawfiknouri/BDD-TDD_ParkingCostCalculator_SpecFlow/workflows/ci-ubuntu.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tawfiknouri/BDD-TDD_ParkingCostCalculator_SpecFlow/actions)

The intention of this project is not create the best parking cost calculator in the world.
We want the simplest parking cost calculator in the world so we can focus on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test Driven Development (TDD) practice

The main goal is to share knowledge !

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or PR.


**The example also appears in the official specflow documentation.**

Thanks for enjoying!


# Requirements

Imagine we were to design a parking cost calculator that calculates the price of parking tickets at the airport. There could be different parking sites like

* Valet Parking
* Short-Term Parking
* Long-Term Garage Parking
* Long-Term Surface Parking
* Economy Lot Parking

With each site having its own set of rules how a ticket price is calculated:
## Valet Parking
- 18.00€ per day
- 12.00€ for five hours or less
## Short-Term Parking
- 2.00€ first hour; $1.00€ each additional 1/2 hour
- 24.00€ daily maximum
## Long-Term Garage Parking
- 2.00€ per hour
- 2.00€ daily maximum
- 72.00€ per week (7th day free)
## Long-Term Surface Parking
- 2.00€ per hour
- 10.00€ daily maximum
- 60.00€ per week (7th day free)
## Economy Lot Parking
- 2.00€ per hour
- 9.00€ daily maximum
- 54.00€ per week (7th day free)
